Hey, my name is Christopher.

I just started to work as a Machine Learning Engineer in August 2021. Throughout my studies I am very much passionate about data-related work. Data Science and Data Engineering including methods of Machine Learning as well as Deep Learning are considered to be some of my hobbies that I love to discuss and share. 
I'd love to get in touch with new people and exchange knowledge on IT-related fields.

kind regards,

Christopher
