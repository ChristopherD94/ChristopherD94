Hey, I'm Christopher.

Since I am looking for Jobs in Data Science, Data Engineering, AI I started to get used to Git and GitHub. 
I am very much interested in pretty much any data-related work because analyzing data is so much fun and one of my biggest passions!
A while back I started to work with tensorflow and keras to improve my knowledge in deep learning. Furthermore I am still practicing with AWS and GCP and constantly try to improve.
I'd love to get in touch with new people and maybe even exchange knowledge on IT-related fields.

Feel free to contact me on my e-mail-account: christopher-danz@web.de

kind regards,

Christopher
